# KaKs_Calculator is a program that calculates nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates through model selection and model averaging.

# Methods for calculating Ka and Ks
Calculating Ka and Ks normally involves three steps. Let us assume that the number of lengths between two DNA sequences compared is n and the number of substitutions
between them is m. To calculate Ka and Ks, we need to count the numbers of synonymous (S) and nonsynonymous (N) sites (S + N = n) and the numbers of synonymous (Sd) 
and nonsynonymous (Nd) substitutions (Sd + Nd = m). Then it is after correcting multiple substitutions that (Nd/N) and (Sd/S) could represent Ka and Ks, respectively, 
since the observed number of substitutions underestimates the real number of substitutions as sequences diverge over time.
Therefore, we can conclude from mentioned above that these methods normally involve three steps to estimate Ka and Ks: counting S and N, counting Sd and Nd, and 
correction for multiple substitutions.

# Format of sequence
KaKs_Calculator accepts quasi-AXT sequence format as follows. Before calculation, gaps and stop codons between compared sequences will be removed.
For example:
NP_000026
ATGCTCCTGTG-CCACTGGCC
ATCCCC-TGCGCTCACTGGAC 

NP_000053
ACAGaTtCTACCc-GCCcACTA--GgtGtt
---ggTTCTCCtACCcA-G-CACTACTggg

Each pair of sequences in an axt file contains three lines: a sequence name line and 2 sequence lines. Pairwise sequences are separated from one another by blank lines.
CAUTION) When you prepare the input file format in linux, some input file is not working following the Format. Try to use "Enter" between pair of sequences.
