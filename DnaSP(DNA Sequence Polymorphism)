DnaSP, DNA sequence polymorphism, is an interactive computer program for the analysis of DNA
polymorphism from nucleotide sequence data. The program calculates several measures of DNA sequence
variation within and between populations (with or without the sliding window method) in noncoding,
synonymous or nonsynonymous sites; linkage disequilibrium, recombination, gene flow and gene
conversion parameters; and also computes some neutrality tests, Fu and Li's, Hudson, Kreitman and
AguadÃ©'s, McDonald and Kreitman, and Tajima's tests. DnaSP can also conduct computer simulations
based on the coalescent process. The input data file is a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), or (new in
version 6) a Multi-MSA file format.

###Processing for preparing data
#You align multi FASTA files(ref.mitogenome vs assembly mitogenome) to DnaSP.
#Before that, you extract fasta files from list of ref.mitogenome or download fasta files from NCBI. ex) NC_numbers

grep ">NC_numbers" refseq.fasta
samtools faidx refseq.fasta NC_numbers > output.fasta(NC_numbers)


#Change header of fasta file

sed -i 's/original_NC_name/changed_name/g' output.fasta && \
sed -i 's/original_NC_name/changed_name/g' output.fasta


#mafft activate (Multiple alignment program for amino acid or nucleotide sequences based on fast Fourier transform)

source activate mafft_env
mafft --thread 32 --auto merged.fasta > merged.fasta.mafft
conda deactivate
#If compared fasta_files data have much variation in each, cannot produce mafft output file. In this case, select closed species in phylogentic tree.
#When use &> log_file & , output file is converted to log_file


#Trimming alignment fasta files

source activate trimal_env
trimal -automated1 -in merged.fasta.mafft -out merged.fasta.mafft.trimal
conda deactivate
#After trimming, DnaSP results are different about polymorphism position.


###After prepare the alignment fasta files, use the files as input files.
